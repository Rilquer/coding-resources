# Some coding resources

A repository to store tutorials and other coding resources, both finalized and in progress

### GIS

- Follow [this link](https://github.com/Rilquer/gcdi-mapping-user-group) for a couple resources on intro to map visualization and GIS tools in R, developed for the [GIS / Mapping Working Group](https://commons.gc.cuny.edu/groups/gis-working-group/) within the [CUNY Graduate Center Digital Initiatives](https://gcdi.commons.gc.cuny.edu).

### Evolutionary Biology

- [Extracting and visualizing Genetic Diversity Distribution from Bird barcode data](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Rilquer/coding-resources/blob/main/evo-bio/bird-barcode/aln_gendiv.html) - <ins>IN PROGRESS</ins>
  - This quick tutorial is being made along with the [RoLE Project]() in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It currently covers introductory topics on importing and organizing DNA sequence in R for calculation of genetic diversity distributions (GDD) of bird communities.
